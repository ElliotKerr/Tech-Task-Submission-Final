This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, you need to install .next. This can by opening the command prompt, cd-ing into the folder of the repository, then typing "npm i". This will install all necesarry packages to run the app.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Final Comments
Starting this project, I had no knowledge of HTML, Java, React or Next.js, so I logged everything I did to complete this project.

Day 0: (Thur)
- recieved task at 4pm
- completed some initial research into Next.js and Tailwind Css
- found that Codecademy had online courses on Next.js
- found that Next.js is based around HTML (didn't realise Java at this point)
- started a course called "Build a website with HTML and CSS" where I learnt the basic syntax of HTML as well as some other structures and how CSS works.
- completed a lesson on creating forms in HTML, which was useful in the final project

Day 1: (Fri)
- started today trying to build the website in HTML to get a feel for the language
- started a course on Next.js, which was not helpful since it was using unknown syntax to me
- after research, it had some JavaScript similarities so I completed some research which included watching some example videos of beginner JavaScript

Day 2: (Sat)
- decided to watch some tutorials online and try to implement them into the app, since I didn't understand a lot about Java or Next.js
- video 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk&t=3407s is an introduction to React
- video 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVnjOPwW4ZA&t=1882s is an introduction to Next.js for beginners.
- completed the apps with the videos in the hopes that I would understand what I needed to do a little more.
- decided to try my hand at Next.js and it was tought.

Day 3: (Sun)
- working a 9-6 at my current job today so no progress made

Day 4: (Mon)
- out with my family so no progress made

Day 5: (Tue)
- tried to work through the problem the same way the videos did but I kept coming accross the same issue
- my draw from the api wasn't returning anything. 
- couldn't go further with the task without it, kept trying to brute force it through without much joy
- ended Tuesday with very little progress for the day, but an idea of Wednesday

Day 6: (Wed)
- decided to search online to see whether a similar problem had been solved, and it had! 
- video 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ZUc7zH8BE created a very similar application using React instead of Next.js
- followed the video, changing bits for Next.js rather than React until I finished the application, then styled it using Tailwind
- finished Day 6 struggling with the upload process and making it work if someone downloaded it.

Day 7: (Thur)
- began the last day emailing Chris for some help with the upload process, since the only files I have uploaded before are Python (.ipynb) and csv files.
- by searching an error code, I manage to find the problem before I got a reply from Chris

Post Interview Additions:
- started working on the links straight after the interview
- did a lot of research into it and found some videos that resembled my task
- completed it to the best of my ability!
